##进化树构建之最大似然法

Maximum likelihood (ML)
	What is the likelihood? --The likelihood of a hypothesis is the proportion to the probability that it is true, which means the likelihood of the hypothesis is the probability of observing data given hypothesis h.
	Phylogeny and Likelihood --The likelihood of phylogeny is the probability of a character state distribution(the data) given that phylogeny. The tree hypothesis(topology+ branch lengths) that maximizes the probability of having observed information is the tree of maximum likelihood, and is to be preferred over less "likely" hypotheses.
	What is the model? --Tree implies nothing regarding the probability of state change. A process model of evolution is required to assess the likelihood of a tree.
