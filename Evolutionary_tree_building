##进化树构建之最大似然法
Maximum likelihood (ML)
	What is the likelihood? --The likelihood of a hypothesis is the proportion to the probability that it is true, which means the likelihood of the hypothesis is the probability of observing data given hypothesis h.
	Phylogeny and Likelihood --The likelihood of phylogeny is the probability of a character state distribution(the data) given that phylogeny. The tree hypothesis(topology+ branch lengths) that maximizes the probability of having observed information is the tree of maximum likelihood, and is to be preferred over less "likely" hypotheses.
	What is the model? --Tree implies nothing regarding the probability of state change. A process model of evolution is required to assess the likelihood of a tree.

##进化树构建之近邻结合法
Neighbor joining(NJ)
	Neighbor joining is a bottom-up(agglomerative) clustering method, which requires knowledge of the distance between each pair of taxa.
1.Based on the current distance matrix, calculate a matrix {\displaystyle Q}Q (defined below).
2.Find the pair of distinct taxa i and j (i.e. with {\displaystyle i\neq j}i\neq j) for which {\displaystyle Q(i,j)}Q(i,j) is smallest. Make a new node that joins the taxa i and j, and connect the new node to the central node. For example, in part (B) of the figure at right, node u is created to join f and g.
3.Calculate the distance from each of the taxa in the pair to this new node.
4.Calculate the distance from each of the taxa outside of this pair to the new node.
5.Start the algorithm again, replacing the pair of joined neighbors with the new node and using the distances calculated in the previous step.
